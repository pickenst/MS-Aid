# MS-AID
**MSAid** by Team Tetrad is a Multiple Sclerosis companion app.
The app allows the user to create alarms, check their local weather, and add medicines with instructional info.

MS Aid was *headed* by **Trey Pickens** with **Anthony Cuentas** as *Documentation Specialist*, **Antonio Valencia-Giles** as *Lead Tester*, and **Treston Balboa** as *Lead Designer*.

**MSAid** requires an internet connection, location permissions, and notification permissions.

Known Issues:
There are still some issues in Toast messages popping up for not found files before file creation, as well as some display issues in the Medicine side of the app.
The weather display could likely be improved to a more efficient method instead of updating after a set interval, possibly not allowing enough time to read from the service.
There may also be some issue with local.properties as during the development of the application a commit was made that broke it and added it to git, but no mention of it not working after its 'fix' has been made.
